This script allows you to create a logout timer similar to the one found on Mint.com.  After a specifed period of inactivity, a warning bar
slides in informing the user his/her session is about to expure, and provides a link to continue the session.  If after 30 seconds (configurable, default) 
the user does not click the continue session link, the user is redirected.
